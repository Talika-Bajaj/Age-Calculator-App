# Frontend Mentor - Age calculator app

![Design preview for the Age calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 30th Frontend Mentor challenge.


Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

Completed this Frontend Mentor challenge by creating an age calculator app that displays age in years, months, and days. This project helped in sharpening my JavaScript and form validation skills. Working with dates in JavaScript can be tricky, making this a great test of my abilities and a valuable learning experience.

**Had fun building!** ðŸš€
